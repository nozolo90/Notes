Created Sunday 03 December 2017

=== Satement ===
* The closer a place is to the equator, the hotter it tends to be.

=== Close to equator ===
* If a place is closer to the equator sun rays dont have to travel through alot of atmosphere to get to the ground,so **less heat is lost**.
* The sunlight is also focused on a smaller area, so the **heat is concentrated**

=== Far from equator ===
* If a place is further away from the equator the opposite is true.
* The sun rays have to travel through more atmospher to get to the ground, and **heat is lost**.
* The sun rays are focused on a larger area due to the curvature of the earth, so the **heat is more spread out**.
