====== Altitude ======


Created Wednesday 06 December 2017

=== Statement ===
* Altitude is how high something is above sea level.

=== Development ===
* The higher the altitude of a place, the colder it tends to be.
* On average the temperature dops by about 7 degrees celcius for every killometer you go up, called the lapse rate.
* This is because the air is thinner and can hold less heat.
* An example is mount killamanjaro in tanzania.
* It is near the equator(lattitude) and in africa, yet because it is so high.
