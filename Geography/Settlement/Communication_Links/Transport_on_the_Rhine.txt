====== Transport on the Rhine ======
Created Saturday 12 May 2018

The Rhine is called **"the main road of Germany''**

=== Why ===
* The Rhine river (and main tributaries) are navigable. Barges are used on the river to carry goods between the north sea and Switzerland.
* The Rhine links many towns together. Many of these locations have grown into great industrial cities and ports because of their location on the Rhine waterway, like France and the Netherlands.a
* The Rhine flows through areas of heavy industry. Raw materials and finished products can be transported up &  down the river.
