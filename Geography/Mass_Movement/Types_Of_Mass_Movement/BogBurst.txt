====== BogBurst ======


Created Saturday 19 August 2017

=== Statement ===
* A bogburst is when a bog saturated with water flows downslope

=== Development ===
* **Bogbursts** occur when bogs absorb **large amounts of rainwater** and **have no way to drain it**
* This causes the bog to become **heavy** and **saturated with water**
* **Peat can then flow downslope** like runny porridge and **cause great damage** over a large area
