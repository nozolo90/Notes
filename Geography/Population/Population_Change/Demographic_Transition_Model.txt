====== Demographic Transition Model ======
Created Saturday 18 November 2017

The Demographic Transition Model is a diagram that shows the phases of natural change that countries go through as they develop.

=== Stage 1 - no example ===
	* Place is **poor**.
	* Birth rates are **high**.
	* **Death rates are also high** because of disease, famine and war.
	* Population **fluctuates** or **grows slowly**.

=== Stage 2 - eg Mali ===
	* Countries **economy begins to develop**
	* Birth rates remain **high**.
	* **Death rates plummet** due to better water, food and medical supplies.
	* Population **"explodes"** and grows rapidly.

=== Stage 3 - eg Brazil ===
	* Economy continues to **improve**.
	* **Birth rates begin to fall** because people begin to plan their families.
	* Population **growth slows down**.

=== Stage 4 - eg Ireland ===
	* **Country is economically developed**.
	* **People live long** but **have few children**.
	* **Birth rates** and **death rates** are **low**.
	* Population increases **very slowly**.

=== Stage 5 - eg Germany ===
	* People have very **few children**.
	* People are more concerned with **material comforts**.
	* Population/Natural **decrease**.
