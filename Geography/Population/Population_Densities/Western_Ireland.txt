Created Saturday 12 May 2018

Western Ireland is very unpolulated

=== History ===
* In the 19th century, people lived off potatoes. They provided high yeild for small plots.
* In the late 1850s, the Great Famine occured. A disease called blight destroyed the potato crop.
* The population fell rapppidly - 1 in 4 people died or emmigrated the country.
* After the fammine, emmigration remained high, as the area provided little employment or oppurtunity so the population of the West stayed on the decrease.
* The economy improved in 1960 and the population began to stabilize, as emmigration fell due to people having more wealth.
* In the late 90s there was an economic boom and people had even more wealth. Immigration replaced emmigration and the population of the west increased.
* An economic crash in 2008 - population increase good enough to maintain population.
