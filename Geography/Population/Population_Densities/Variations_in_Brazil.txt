Created Saturday 12 May 2018

In Brazil, Coastal areas are more populated than the Amazon Basin.

=== Coastal Areas ===
* In the 16th century, the portuguese colonised the east coast of Brazil.
* Some towns grew into cities, like Rio de Janerio and Seo Paulo.
* The portuguese set up huge coffee and cotton plantations on the coast.
* They imported slaves to do the work.

=== Amazon Basin ===
* European settlers found it hard to settle in the Amazon Basin.
* They did not like the hot, wet climate or the dense rainforrets (nicknamed 'Green Hell').
* When they cleared some parts of the  forests for agriculture, the land became leached and infertile without its tree cover.
* Local tribes also died of European diseases which they had no immunity to.
