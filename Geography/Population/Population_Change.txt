====== Population Change ======
Created Saturday 18 November 2017

World Population Change is called **natural change**.
It can be calculated by measuring **birth rates** against **death rates**.

=== Birth rates ===
	* Number of **live births** per thousand of the population.
	* When the **birth rates** are **higher** than the **death rates**, **natural increase** occurs.

=== Death rates ===
	* Number of deaths per thousand of the population.
	* When the **death rates** are **higher** than the **birth rates**, **natural decrease** occurs.

Countries go through **different phases** of natural increase and decrease.
Geographers have conjured up a diagram to show these changes called the **Demographic Transition Model**.

=== Factors that influence population change ===
	* War
	* Food Supply
	* Education
	* Improved Technology
	* [[+Health|Health]]

War

=== Point ===
	* Wars can reduce populations. The cause the death of soilders and civillians.

=== Example ===
	* Germany lost **7 million people** in world war 1 and 2. Thousands of Irish died in the war aswell

Food

=== Point ===
	* As a countries **economy** **develops**, its **food supplies **usually** improve**.
	* Better food supplies lead to people **living longer** and **healthier** which leads to population growth.

=== Example ===
	* **Germany lost** **7 million people** during **ww1** and **2**. Thousands of Irish also died in that war.

Tech

=== Statement ===
* Some technology helps people live longer so it asssists population growth

=== Developmet ===
* Farm machinery increases food production
* Medical equipment saves lives, lowering death rates.
* Pumps and water treatment equipment help provide safe and clean water.

Edu

=== Statement ===
	* People who are well educated and literate are more likely to understand and take part in familly planning scheemes aimed at reducing birth rates.

=== Development ===
	* Therefore countries with good education tend to have fewer birth rates which can slow population growth.
	* An example is Germany. Germany is a country with a very high standard of education. Along with many other factors education has contributed to its low birth rate.

Hlth

=== Statement ===
* Food, water and medical supplies have increased greatly over the years.
* This has resulted in people living longer and healthier.

=== Development ===
* Deaths from curable diseses such as whopping couugh and gastroentritis have decreased greatly.
* As death rates decline, populations tend to grow.
* In brazil, some people have benifited from improved food, water and medical supplies.
* This is part of the reason brazil's population has more than trebled in the last 50 years

Womans

=== Statement ===
* When women enjoy equality with men, they are empowered to make more decisions relating to their lives/
* As the decision making power of women increases, birth rates generally decline.

=== Development ===
* In germany, a country with great equality, women and men recieve the same ammount of education and have an option to work outside the home.
* In brazil, where women usually have little or no formal education, they seldom have the chance to have a carreer outside the home.
* They tend to stay at home and care for larger famillies.
