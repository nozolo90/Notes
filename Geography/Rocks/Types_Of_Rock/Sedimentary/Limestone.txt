====== Limestone ======
Created Sunday 20 August 2017

=== How it's formed ===
	* **Limestone** formed at the bottom of the sea.
	* Layers of dead sea creatures, sediment and plants are deposited on the sea floor.
	* Over time,  these layers build up and the lower ones begin to be compressed into solid rock.

Layers of **limestone** are called **strata**
The sections of these layers are called **bedding planes**
The separation between bedding planes are called **joints**

Areas where limestone is visible on the surface are called [[Geography:The Forces Of Weathering:Landforms:Karst area|Karst areas]]

The **carbonation** dissolves **notches** into Karst Areas called **grykes**
Rainwater seeps into the **grykes** and dosen't stay on the high non eroded points called **clints**
The **grykes** get deeper but the **clints** stay high
This gives **Karst areas** a unique landscape

=== Characteristics ===
	* Color - Grey
	* [[Sedimentary]] Rock
	* Permeable (water can pass through its cracks)
	* can be dissolved through [[Geography:The Forces Of Weathering:Weathering:Chemical Weathering:Carbonation|Carbonation]]
	* Can contain **fossils**

=== Found in ===
	* The Burren Co.Clare ( [[Geography:The Forces Of Weathering:Landforms:Karst area|Karst area]] )

=== Uses ===
	* fertilizer
	* lake acid neutralization
	* building monuments
	* cement
	* glass
