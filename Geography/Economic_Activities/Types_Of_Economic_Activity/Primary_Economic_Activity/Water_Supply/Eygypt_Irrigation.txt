====== Eygypt Irrigation ======


Created Thursday 24 August 2017

People live in the floodplains of the river nile because the closer you are to the river the easier it is to get water

crops could also grow there because annual flooding fertilized the soil

In **1960**, the aswan high dam was proposed to control the flow of the nile
in **1975** it finished construction, stopping the annual floods
millions of liters of water would be stored in the reservoir, **lake nassar**

=== Advantages of the dam ===
	* Water could be controlled allowing the dam to release water into pipes leading to farmland
	* This allows farmers to farm more food to feed the growing population
	* Crops can be grown all year round.

=== Disadvantages of the dam ===
	* The Nile floodplain no longer floods naturally so farmers have to buy expensive fertilizer
	* The pipes are infected with a water snail that affects humans
	* Lots of water is lost due to evapouration
