**Erosional** Landform

=== Statement ===
* Overhanging thing near sea

=== Development ===
* **Destructive Waves** cut into the rock eroding a **notch**
* Over time this causes an **overhang** to develop
* When the notch is cut deeper into the rock, **the overhang collapses**(no support)
* Process repeats - Cliff Retreats
* As it retreats, a **wave cut Platform** is created
* A wave cut platform is a surface of **rock pieces from the collapsed overhang**
* An example is the **Cliffs of Moher Co.Clare**
