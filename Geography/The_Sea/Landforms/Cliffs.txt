====== Cliffs ======

Created Friday 18 August 2017

Cliffs are an **erosional** land form.

=== Statement ===
* Cliffs are overhanging things near the sea.

=== Development ===
* **Destructive Waves** cut into a rock face, which erodes a **notch** over time.
* this causes an **overhang** to develop.
* When the waves cut deeper into the rock, **the overhang collapses** because the rock that once supported it has been destroyed.
* This process repeats, and the cliff retreats.
* As it retreats, a **wave cut platform** is created.
* A wave cut platform is a surface of **rock pieces from the collapsed overhang**.
* An example is the **Cliffs of Moher Co.Clare**
