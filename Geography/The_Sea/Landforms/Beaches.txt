====== Beaches ======

Created Friday 18 August 2017

=== Statement ===
	* A **Beach **is made out of sand or shingle(small stones)

=== Development ===
	* The [[The Sea:Waves|Swash]] carries material up the beach.
	* The **heavier material stays high on the beach** because the [[The Sea:Waves|backwash]] isn't strong enough to pull it back into the Sea
	* The **backwash only carries lighter material** down towards the beach
	* For this reason we can say that the beach is organized with the **heavier materials on top and the lighter material near the bottom**
	* During a storm the Swash is very powerful, it can force heavy stones very high onto the beach where they remain
	* we call these heavy rocks a **storm beach**

=== Example ===
	* An example of a Storm Beach and Beach in **Tramore Co.Waterford**
