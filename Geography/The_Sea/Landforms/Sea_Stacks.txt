====== Sea Stacks ======

Created Friday 18 August 2017

**Erosional **landform.

=== Statement ===
* **Sea Stacks** are pillars of rock separated from the coast

=== Development ===
* Further erosion of [[Sea Arches]] cause the arch to widen.
* Eventually the arch roof can no longer support itself and it **collapses**.
* This leaves a **pillar of rock** separated from the coast.

* An example is **Hook Head in County Wicklow**.
