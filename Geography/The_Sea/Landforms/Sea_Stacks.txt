====== Sea Stacks ======

Created Friday 18 August 2017

**Erosional **landform.

=== Statement ===
	* **Sea Stacks** are pillars of rock separated from the coast

=== Development ===
	* When [[Sea Arches]] are eroded further they become **wider**
	* Eventually the roof can no longer support itself and **collapses**
	* This leaves a **pillar of rock** separated from the coast

* An example is **Hook Head Co.Wicklow**
