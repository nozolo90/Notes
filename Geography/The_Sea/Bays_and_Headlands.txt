====== Bays and Headlands ======

Created Friday 18 August 2017

a **bay** is a wide curved opening in the coastline
a **headland** in a piece of land(hard rock) jutting out into the sea

=== How they happen ===
* They occur when there are **different types rock** (**soft** and **hard**) along the coastline
* The **softer** **rock** is eroded **fast** forming a curved **bay**
* The **harder** **rock** is eroded **slowly** so thy stick out into the sea forming a **headland**
* If **headlands** are large enough, they shelter the bay from d[[Waves|estructive waves]] and a [[Landforms:Beaches|beach]] may form
