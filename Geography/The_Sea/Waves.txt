=== The size of waves is determined by two things ===
* the **fetch**
* the **wind power**

the **fetch** is the maximum length of open water wind can blow before hitting land.

Waves are able to affect the coastline.

=== two types of swash ===
	* **Swash** is the white foamy water that **flows up** on the beach - it [[The Sea:Deposition|deposits]].
	* **Backwash** is the water that flows **back into the sea** when the wave loses power - it erodes.

===== there are two types of waves =====

=== Constructive Waves ===
	* **Constructive waves** are waves with a strong swash but weak backwash.
	* they **add** material to the coast and [[Sea Deposition And Erosion|deposit]].

=== Destructive Waves ===
	* **Destructive waves** are waves with a weak **swash** but strong **backwash**.
	* They **remove** material from the coast and erode.

Waves break on the shore due to **friction** with the seabed
