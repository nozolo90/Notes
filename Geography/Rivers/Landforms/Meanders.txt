**Bends or curves along a river**

=== How They're formed ===
	* Water flows quicker on the outer side of each bend
	* It erodes the outer side with [[Rivers:Erosion:Hydraulic action|Hydraulic action]] and [[Rivers:Erosion:Abrasion|Abrasion]]
	* Water flows slower on the inner side of each bend
	* The river [[Rivers:Deposition|Deposits]] material here
	* This continues making the bends sharper
An example is **Mature Stage of The Shanon**
