====== Leves ======


Created Saturday 19 August 2017

**Leves **are raised banks of deposited material found along the banks of a river

=== How they're formed ===
	* when a river floods it spreads out over the **floodplain** and looses energy
	* The **heaviest material** is deposited **close to the river**
	* After many floods this deposited material forms **leves **along the side of the river
An example is **The Old Stage Of The Liffey**
