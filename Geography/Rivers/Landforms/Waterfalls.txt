====== Waterfalls ======


Created Saturday 19 August 2017

A **Waterfall **is when a river falls over a ledge

=== How its formed ===
	* A band of **hard** **rock** lies on an area of **soft** **rock**
	* **The river **[[Rivers:Erosion|erodes]]** the soft rock faster than it erodes the hard rock** so that **a downwards drop develops** where hard and soft rock meet
	* The river **falls over this drop** as a waterfall
	* A [[+Plunge Pool|Plunge Pool]] develops **at the base of the waterfall**.
	* As the plunge pool gets bigger and bigger, it undercuts the hard rock.
	* the soft rock that was once supporting the weight of the hard rock is eroded and the unsupported **hard rock collapses into the plunge pool**
	* This process continues and **the river erodes upstream**
An example  is **Niagra Falls**
