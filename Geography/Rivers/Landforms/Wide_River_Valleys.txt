====== Wide River Valleys ======


Created Saturday 19 August 2017

This landform forms in the [[Rivers:Stages of The River:Mature Stage|Mature Stage]]
**A Wide River Valley**

=== How it formed ===
	* In the mature stage rivers begin to erode more sideways than downwards
	* The valley becomes more wide and flat
	* [[Geography:The Forces Of Weathering:Weathering|Weathering]] and [[Geography:Mass Movement|Mass Movement]] continue to wear away at the sides of the river, but since its eroding less in a downward direction its less steep
An example is **The Mature Stage Of The Boyne**
