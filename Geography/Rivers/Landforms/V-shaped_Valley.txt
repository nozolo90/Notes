====== V-shaped Valley ======


Created Saturday 19 August 2017

This landform is found in the [[Rivers:Stages of The River:Youthful Stage|Youthful Stage]]
**A valley shaped like a V**

=== How its formed ===
	* [[Rivers:Erosion:Hydraulic action|Hydraulic action]] and [[Rivers:Erosion:Abrasion|Abrasion]] erode the riverbed, deepening it
	* [[Geography:The Forces Of Weathering:Weathering|Weathering]] breaks up the Rocks and dirt on the valley sides
	* They eventually collapse and the debris falls into the river
	* Debris is [[Rivers:River Transportation|Transported]] by the river downstream
An example is **The Youthful Stage Of The Liffey**
