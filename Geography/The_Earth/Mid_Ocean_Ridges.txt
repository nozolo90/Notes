====== Mid Ocean Ridges ======


Created Sunday 20 August 2017

When two [[Plates]] move apart, magma seeps out of gaps they leave and cools forming an [[Geography:Rocks:Types Of Rock:Igneous|Igneous]] rock ridge

Under water [[Volcanoes]] can form on **Mid Ocean Ridges**
If They get tall enough, they emerge out of the water and become **Volcanic Islands** like **Iceland**

An example is **The Mid-Atlantic Ridge**
