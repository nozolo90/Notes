Created Wednesday 02 May 2018

=== St Teresa of Avila ===
* St Teresa of Avlila discovered the practice of **contemplative prayer**.
* She taught it to fellow nuns and all over Spain.
* She once thought that prayer was only vocal.
* She wrote a book called 'interior castle' where she described a person developing in contemplative prayer as somebody entering deep into a castle with many rooms. At the center there is God.
