====== Stages Of  The hajj ======


Created Tuesday 12 December 2017

The hajj is pilgramage to Mecca that all muslims must do in their lives at least once.

=== 1. Mecca ===
* Muslims **ritually wash themselves**.
* Men **shave their beards**.
* They **change into white robes**. This shows that they are all **equal** in the presence of Allah.

=== 2. The Ka'ba ===
* The Ka'Ba is the **most sacred shrine** of Islam
* Muslims arrive at mecca and circle the Ka'ba 7 times.
* There is a "Black Stone" which Muslims believe Allah sent from heaven. Muslims may kiss it as they pass.

=== 3. Hills of Safa and Mara ===
* Muslims walk or run between these two hills **7 times**.
* In the past this was outside but now it is in a tunnel.
* Muslims drink water from the holy well called **zamzam**.

=== 4. Plain of Arafat ===
* It is where Muhammad delivered his last sermon.
* Muslims spend a day there praying and praying for forgiveness.
* This plane is 24 kilometers away from mecca.

=== 5. Pillars of Mina ===
* Muslims throw stones at these pillars.
* This reminds them of when Abraham threw stones at the devil to ward him away.
* **Muslims then return to the Ka'ba and circle it 7 more times**
