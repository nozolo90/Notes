The Qu'ran is the **sacred text** of Islam.

It is around the same size as the Christian New Testament.
The book is split into **144 chapters **called **surrahs.**

Muslims wash their hands before touching the book.
The book is written in Arabic, and it is read from right to left.

=== How it was written ===
* **God spoke to Mohamed** through **Gabriel**.
* Mohamed **learned the word of god** passed to him by Gabriel thoroughly.
* Mohamed **passes the word of God** **down** to his followers.
* After Mohamed's death(**622AD**), **oral** **and** **written sources** were collected.
* After **20 years** they were compiled into a single book, the Qu'ran.

Muslims respect the Qu'ran because they consider it to be the direct word of Allah.
