The Qu'ran is the **sacred text** of islam.

It is around the same size as the Christian New Testament.
The book is split into **144 chapters **called **surrahs.**

Muslims wash their hands before touching the book.
The book is written in arabic, and it is read from right to left.

=== How it was written ===
* **God spoke to Muhamed** through **Gabriel**.
* Muhamed **learned the word of god** passed to him by gabriel thouroughly.
* Muhamed **passes the word of God** **down** to his followers.
* After Muhameds death(**622AD**), **oral** **and** **written sources** were collected.
* It took **20 years** to compile them all into a single book, the Qu'ran

Muslims respect the Qu'ran because they consider it to be the direct word of God.
