Created Sunday 10 September 2017

=== Kingdom Of God - KOG ===
* The KOG is Jesus' vision for what he wanted the world to be.
* He let people know about the KOG through **parables,** **miracles and table fellowship**.

=== Table Fellowship ===
* This is **how Jesus showed kindness during meals**, and had meals with people who were considered outcasts.
* An example is **when he ate with the hated tax collector Zachaeus**, who had cheated many people out of their money.
* After they ate, Zachaeus promised to repay everybody he had scammed.
* Another example is during **the** **last supper** when Jesus surprised the disciples by washing their feet.
* Jesus wanted them to know that he was one of them and he respected them.
* This let people know that **everybody** **is welcome in the KOG.**

=== Discipleship ===
* Discipleship refers to learning from a teacher.
* A **Disciple** is somebody who learns from a teacher.
* Jesus' Disciples helped spread what they learned about the word of God.
* If you are a Christian today, you are a new disciple of Jesus.
* Without Discipleship, Christianity would not exist.

=== Parables ===
* Parables were stories told by Jesus with a hidden meaning.
* They were made in such a way that people could relate to them.
* This allows people to easily understand the Kingdom Of God.

=== Miracles ===
* Miracles were amazing acts or deeds carried out by Jesus to show the power and love of God.
* There were four types of miracles.
* **Nature miracles, expelling miracles, raising to life miracles** and **healing miracles**.
* An example is when Jesus healed the paralyzed man in Capernaum, which was a healing miracle.
* An example is the parable of the lost sheep that lets us know that God cares about all of us.
