====== Life as a worker ======
Created Wednesday 06 February 2019

Life as a worker was bad.

=== Working ===
* Wages all less than 1 pound 50.
* You are beaten and treated badly,
* Bad bone health because people stood for long hours.
* Children are dipped in water to wake them up.

=== Houses ===
* Crownded.
* The sanitation was poor.
* The water was unclean. It contained sewage.
* Woke early in the morning by a siren.
