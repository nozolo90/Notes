====== Industrial Revolution Worker ======
Created Monday 14 May 2018

=== Intro ===
I am a worker in a textile factory in Manchester in the year 1850. My working conditions are terrible.

=== Factory working conditions ===
I recieve terrible wages even though I work for over 14 hours each day.
The factory is hot and stuffy and we are not allowed to open the windows.
My little siblings also work at this factory. They earn a fraction of my pay and are treated badly too.
They are only children but they must work long hours like me. If they get tired, they are dipped in water.
They are used to crawl into machines when things get stuck and could easily lose an air.
On Saturdays, we get half day. We have a poor diet.

=== Living conditions ===
We live in overcrowded tenement houses.
There is no pumps or toilet facilities.
Most of the roofs leak and we sleep on straw.
Diseases like Typhoid and TB spread easilly.

=== How it is improving ===
I have heard of a man called Robert Owen who treats his workers much better.
Certain polititians like Lord Shaftsbury are campagning for change aswell.
The government has made reports on conditions called the blue books.
//And//
Some slums are being demolished.
People are being vaccinated
//And//
People are starting to organise a sport called football on saturday afternoons.
We also do boxing and cock fighting.
The steam engine in trains has allowed some people to go to the beach on sundays.
Good for them.
