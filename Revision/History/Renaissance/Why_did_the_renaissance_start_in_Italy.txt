====== Why did the renaissance start in Italy ======
Created Tuesday 14 August 2018

=== Italy was the centre of the old Roman empire ===
* In every town in Italy, there were ruins of the old roman empire. This reminded italians of the achievements of their ancestors.
* The italian language was also based on latin, which was the language of the romans. This made it easy for italians to read old roman books.

=== Greek scholars ===
* In 1453 the Turks invaded Greece and many greek scholars fled to Ital.
* They brought many of their manuscripts with them and the italians became interested in greek ideas aswell.

=== Wealthy italian merchants ===
* Italian merchants were very wealthy. They brought spices and skills from Asia and sold them to the rest of europe.
* This made them very rich and gave them enough money to spend on grand buildings and works of art.

=== Influence of forgein ideas ===
* Italian traders came into contact with people like the Arabs and the Chineese which had much more advanced civilisations than them.
* They brought home many ideas from their travels and became critical of the old ways of doing things in europe.

=== Independent city states ===
* While most of europe was ruled by kings and nobles, Italy had no one over all ruler.
* It was divided into city states and the citezens were open to new ideas.
* For example, the Sforza, a **mili**tary family ruled over **milan**. The Medicis, a banking family ruled florence and the poper ran rome.
