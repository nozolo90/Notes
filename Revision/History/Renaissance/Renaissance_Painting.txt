====== Renaissance Painting ======
Created Sunday 26 May 2019

The renaissance saw many changes in art, especiall in the drawing of people.

=== Changes ===
* People started to study **anatomy** more thoroughly. Some artists sliced up dead bodies to see how the bones and muscles operated. This allowed their pictures to be more realistic.
* People started to draw things smaller as they went into the background, which was known as **perspective**. This gave renaissance pictures much more depth.
* **Portraits** became more popular during the renaissance.
* The **sfumato** technique was introduced. In this techniques, artists would blend different colors together using tiny brush strokes. This allowed for much smoother color transitions, for use in skin tones, and shadows.
* Artists started to use **oil paints**. They began to mix their colors with **linseed oil** which dried slower and gave artists more time to perfect their work. In the past, artists used egg white which dried much quicker.
* Artists started to use **canvas** to paint on. When it was stretched out, the paint dried slower and was less likely to crack.
* Frescos were introduced. These were where paintings were painted directly onto a wall  surface.
