====== Renaissance Sculpting ======
Created Sunday 26 May 2019

In the middle ages, sculptures were usually unrealistic and only made to complement buildings.
In the renaissance, sculptors copied the ways of the romans and greeks and made stand alone statues to show the human body.
They were often nude.
Sculptors sliced up dead bodies to see how they were made.
