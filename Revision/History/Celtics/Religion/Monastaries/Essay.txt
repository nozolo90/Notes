I am an early Christian monk in Ireland. My name is Francis and the year is 540AD. I chose to be a monk because I believed that it would bring me closer to god.
I live in a monastary. This is a kind enclosed settlment. They are usually in remote places, like mine called inis mor off the coast of the aran islands. This is so that we dont get distracted and we remain holy. The monastary is self sufficient. We have a farm and a water supply so we have no need to leave.
Life as a monk is one of obedience and routine. We pray alot during the day.
I start the day with my matins, which are morning prayers and putting on my uncomfortabel habbit. Then I go to eat at the refectory. We eat in scilence as the abbot (head monk) reads lines from the bible.
In our monastarty there are many buildings. The one that stands out is the round tower. This is a building that we use for storage of valuables, a hiding place if we are attacked, and as a bell tower to call each other to prayer.
Then there are beehive huts where we live. Tthey are single celled.and small.
Then there is the scriptoriom where scribes make manuscripts.
We have a high stone cross too.
