====== Catholic Church Problems ======


Created Wednesday 29 November 2017

===== Unholy Popes =====
* At the time, many **popes did not live holy lives**.
* They cared more about **art** and **politics** then religion.
* example **Sixtus IV**, who supported art and science, and was involved in a plot to get lorenzo de medici murdered in mass.

===== Wealth of Church =====
* Most bishops at the time were from **wealthy** families.
* They **built large** **mansions** and **palaces** to show their wealth.
* They cared more about **their own lives** and less about the **religious needs** of the dioces.
* Monastaries were usually very wealthy too, and owned huge ammounts of land.

===== Church Abuses =====

== Nepotism - first ==
* When relatives are appointed to positions in the church, even though they may not be qualified.
* eg **Sixtux IV** appointing nephews.

== Simony - mony ==
* When people pay to be appointed to positions in the church, even though they may not be qualified.

== Pluralism - plural ==
* When members of the church hold more than one position. eg church in two parishes.

== Absenteism - absent ==
* Bishops and Priests not living in their dioceses or parishes.
* Closeley ascociated with pluralism.

===== Indulgences =====
* Indulgences were large sums of money paid to the church that they claimed would reduce their time in purgatory and bring them to heaven.
