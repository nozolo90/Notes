====== Open Field System ======


Created Tuesday 22 August 2017

Each peasant familly had some **strips** of farmland on each of the fields
There was a **commons** where all of the animals were kept
**Oxen** were used to sow seeds

=== This was in-eficient and caused trouble because : ===
* If your neighbours crops are **unattended** , it could mess up your crops
* You had to move from **field** to **field** to harvest all your crops
* If one **animal** gets sick all of the **animals** **get** **sick** too


=== Instead you could : ===
	Have each peasant have continuous strips of land
	
	{{~/Pictures/OpenFieldSystem.png}}


Each year, one of the fields would be left **fallow** with nothing growing.
This kept the soil **fertile**.
**Crop** **rotation** would take place
