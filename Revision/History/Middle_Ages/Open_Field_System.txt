====== Open Field System ======


Created Tuesday 22 August 2017

Each peasant familly had some **strips** of farmland on each of the fields.
There was a **commons** where all of the animals were kept.
One of the fields would be left **fallow** with nothing growing. The two others were planted with wheat, then oat or barly.
The planted fields would rotate each year to keep them fertile.
**Oxen** were used to sow seeds

=== This method was ineficient and caused trouble because ===
* If your neighbours crops are unattended, it could mess up your crops
* You had to move from field to field to harvest all your crops
* If one animal gets sick all of the other animals in the common may get sick too.
