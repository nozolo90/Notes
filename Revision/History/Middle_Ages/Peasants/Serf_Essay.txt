Serfs in medival Ireland were types of peasants. The belonged to a local lord. The lord was the person who had rights all the land in the manor, a small village.

A serf's job was to farm the land given to them. The land in a medival manor was typically farmed using the open field system. There were 4 fields. One was used for grazing animals, called the commons and the other three were used for growing crops. Each peasant family would own a strip of land on each of the 3 growing fields. Crop rotation would take place on the fields. One rotating field would be left fallow so it could regain fertility.

Most serfs lived in one roomed homes, so they cooked and slept in the same room. They were made of wattle and daub, which was a wooden frame plastered with a mix of mud, dung and straw. They had tatched roofs. In the winter months, animals would be brought inside for safety and warmth.

=== What do they eat ===
A serf ate alot of bread and cheese. They ate pottage too. They drank ale, which was safer than water. They ate very little meat as animals were very valuable.

Serfs made their own clothes using cotton or linen. They dyed their clothes using berries or mosses. Men wore tunics and women wore dreesses with bonnets.

Serfs did not work on sundays and other holy days. Some games they played were knoughts and crosses and droughts. They also enjoyed wrestling.
