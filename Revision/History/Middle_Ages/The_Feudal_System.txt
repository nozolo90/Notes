====== The Feudal System ======


Created Tuesday 22 August 2017

The feudal system was the way that society was organised in the middle ages.

The king owned all the land. He kept 1/4 of it for his own use known as demese.
The king's followers were called **vassals**, and included bishops, lords and abbots.
knights received land from the local lords and in exchange they would protect it and be loyal
Serfs and freemen which were peasants farmed on the vasals' and the knight's land.
