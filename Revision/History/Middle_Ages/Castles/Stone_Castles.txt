* The **bawn**/**bailey**/**courtyard** where soilders lived.
* **Stables** for knights' horses.
* **kitchens** where cooks made food.
* A **forge** where a smith worked. They made metal armour, horseshoues.etc.
* A **well** which provided fresh water supply without leaving the castle.
* Toilets called **latrines**.

=== Features for protection ===
* There were the **battlements** on top of the keep were soldiers looked out for enemies.
* Paths on top of the walls called **ramparts**.
* Walls on the ramparths that you can peep out of, attack then cover called **curtain walls**.
* There were strong towers along the walls called **turrets**.
* There was a **drawbridge** which rose when the castle was under attack. It also had a **portcuillis** as a stronger defence mechanism.
* There was a ditch around the castle making it less accesible to the enemy called a **moat**.
