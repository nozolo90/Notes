====== Dating Artifacts ======


Created Monday 21 August 2017

After artifacts have been found, they have to be **dated** so we know how old they are

=== Dendrochronology ===
* **Dendrochronology**, also known as **tree ring dating** is a type of artifact dating that is usually only useful where wood is found along with the artifact (or the artifact is made of wood).
* They look at the rings on the Timber found and compare it with Tree rings of certain times.
* They decide how old the artifact is based on which era of tree rings it matches

=== Stratigraphy ===
* Stratigraphy is a type of way to date artifacts . They decide how old the artfact is based on how deep the it is found.

=== Carbon 14 Dating ===
* They measure how much **Carbon 14 **is in organic matter to see how old it is.
* **Carbon 14** is a chemical that natural occurs in living things.
* When a living thing dies, its Carbon 14 levels slowly deplete, so by looking at how much Carbon 14 is in a plant/ animal, we can see how long its been dead.

After artifacts are found and [[Dating Artifacts|dated]] they are put in a museum
