=== Who ruled france ===
* At the time, france was ruled by **king louis XVI**.
* He became king at 20 years old in 1774.
* He belived that his power came from God, so there was no elected parliament and he chose his own advisors.
* People did not like his wife, **marine antoinette**. She was an austrian ( enemy of the french ) and people thought that she controlled king louis.

=== Estates ===
* [[+The 3 Estates|3 Estates]]

=== Problems in france / Causes of rebellion ===
* **Enlightenment writers -** influenced people to question the king's power.
* **Taxes -** taxes like the **gabelle** on salt, **feudal dues** to the local lord, the **tithe** and the high bread price made the french very unhappy.
* **Impact of the american revolution -** many french soilders who had fought in America wanted to see some of the American's freedoms introduced in framce.
* **France bankrupt -** the american revolution was one in a long line of wars that the french had aided in. It had left france bankrupt and they needed more money.

=== Voting by order, another problem ===
* **Voting by order -** each estate would get one vote. This was unfair because the two rich estates would always gang up on the 3rd estate.
* A better and fairer way to do this is **voting by head** where each person gets their own vote.

=== Estates General in may 1789 ===
* France was **bankrupt** and needed more money. The easiest way to do this was to increase taxes so that is what king louis tried to do.
* He wanted the nobles to pay more taxes but they refused and forced king LXVI to call an **estates general**.
* this was a meeting of the three estates to vote on a topic. They used the unfair **voting by order** system. The third estate was hoping to achieve **voting by head**.

=== National Assembly ===
* When **voting by head** was not achieved, the third estate split apart from the 1st and 2nd estate into the **national assembly**.
* After the place where the **natiional **assembly usually met was found locked up, they vowed to meet in an indoor tennis court until their demands were met. **Tennis coart oath**.
* Eventually the 1st and 2nd estate were ordered by the king to join the national assembly.

=== Storming of the bastille in 14 July 1789 ===
* There was strong support for the national assembly in Paris, but the parisians feared that the king was marching up to paris to crush the revolution.
* The **national gaurd** was set up to protect the city.
* After obtaining muskets, they stormed the bastille where gunpowder was kept.
* The bastile was a hated symbol of the kings power and all over europe, people celebrated its fall.

=== After that... ===
* The national assembly abolished the feudal dues, ending the nobles power.
* They wrote downtheir consititution on the doccument **THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND OF THE CITEZEN**.

=== New slogan ===
* Liberty, equality and fraternity.

=== Robespierre ===
* Robespierre was the leader of a group who pushed for a french republic called the **jacobins**.
* He was influenced by Rosseau, and **enlightenment writer** to be against then kings power.

=== King killed ===
* In 1790, the **CIVEL CONSTITUTION OF THE CLERGY** was passed, bringing the clergy under the control of the government.
* King Louis was a religious man and didn't like these changes, so he decided to leave the country to Belgium.
* In June 1791, they were captured at **Varennes** near the border. The people were devided on what to do with him. This showed that he was an enemy of the revoluyion and needed to be killed to robespierre.
