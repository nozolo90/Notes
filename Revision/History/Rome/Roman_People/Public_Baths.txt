====== Public Baths ======


Created Tuesday 22 August 2017

There were public baths **in every roman city**
First, a **slave** would **massage** you with olive **oil**
Then, you could go to a **warm pool** (**tepidarium**) to relax or the **calidarium** - a **hot pool**
Finally you would go to a **frigidarium**, a **cold** water pool where you could sit and refresh
