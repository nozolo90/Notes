* Eoin McNiel said that he would only allow his soldiers to fight if 1: Britain tried to introduce conscription into Ireland or 2: Britain started executing rising leaders.
* So Padraig Pearse from the IRB forged a letter that said that Eoin McNiel should surrender, so lhe said that he would let his men fight.
* This famous forgery was called the **castle doccument**.

=== But everything went wrong on the friday before the rising ===
* The Aud was captured off the coast of Kerry so Ireland had a shortage of guns and ammunition.
