Created Sunday 07 October 2018

=== Remember the IRB? well this is them now ===
* **Padraig Pearse**, Thomas Clarke, Eamonn Ceannt, Thomas McDonagh, **Joseph Plunkett**, Sean MacDiarmada, **James Connolly**
* They are an gery and wanted to kick Britain out of Ireland.

Note on timing: Britain is fighting Germany in Europe rn so they are kind of weak.

=== Double whammy ===
* They were also going to attack on easter sunday so that nobody would expect it.

=== They needed guns ===
* **Rodger Casement** was sent to get guns from Germany, Brtains enemy.
* Germany sends guns to the IRB.

=== They needed men ===
* Many of Eoin McNiels Irish Volunteers stayed in Ireland and did not join the british army to fight Germany. 11,000 of them to be exact.
* Eoin McNiel said that he would only allow his soldiers to fight if 1: Britain tried to introduce conscription into Ireland or 2: Britain started executing rising leaders.
* So Padraig Pearse from the IRB forged a letter that said that Eoin McNiel should surrender, so lhe said that he would let his men fight.
* This famous forgery was called the **castle doccument**.

=== But everything went wrong on the friday before the rising ===
* The Aud was captured off the coast of Kerry so Ireland had a shortage of guns and ammunition.
* Eoin realised thet the castle document was a forgery and he told people to "call off the parade". They only had 1500 men to fight in the rising.

=== They lost their guns and they lost their men, but they went along with the rising anyways ===
