====== War of independance ======
Created Sunday 14 October 2018

The **"War" of independance** was really just a series of ambush attacks against the British that resulted in the Anglo Irish treaty being signed.
It started after Sinn Fein came into power in 1918.

Sinn Fein starts its moves towards Irish by setting up its own Irish government called the Dail in 1919.
