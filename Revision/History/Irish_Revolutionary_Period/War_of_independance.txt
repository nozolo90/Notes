====== War of independance ======
Created Sunday 14 October 2018

The **"War" of independance** was really just a series of ambush attacks against the British that resulted in the Anglo Irish treaty being signed.

It started after Sinn Fein came into power in 1918.
They set up therir own Irish government called the Dail in 1919.
The war began on the 21st of January 1919, when 2 RIC members were killed in Tipperary. This was the same day that the the 1st Dail met.

=== Some Jobs ===
* Micheal Collins was the minister for Finance.
* Countess Markievicz was minister for Labour.

=== Cash Money Operations ===
* Eamon de Valera went to America to gain support for an Irish Republic. He didn't gain official recognition but he returned with 4 mil stacks of USA cash money.
* Micheal Collins organised a loan of 350,000 pounds.
* Both of these helped Sinn Feim buy guns and run the government.

Sinn Fein courts begin to replace local British ones.

=== Michael Collins Squad ===
* They were a group of spies who's job was to find and kill British spies.
* Had spies all over the country in different occupations who would inform Collins of any suspicious activity.
* They used guerilla warfare(ambush) tactics. The spies wore regular clothes, then they would shoot, or ambush lorries then dissapear.
* The squad was helped by locals aswell who knew the surrounding area and gave the squad information.

The RIC were having trouble, so the **black and tans** were brought in to help
The Irish Volunteers from the 1916 rising had became the IRA at this point.

=== The Black And tans ===
* These were ex WW1 soldiers brought into Ireland to help fight Irish rebels.
* They were undisciplined and often burned down houses.

=== Bloody Sunday 21st of November 1920 ===
* In the morning, the cairo gang who were a group British spies were all killed by Collins Squad.
* The Black and tans then opened fire on croke park spectators in retalliation.
* 14 people died. This included 2 young children.

=== Begining of Civil War ===
* GB was getting a bad wrap for being cruel to Ireland.
* The IRA was running out of guns and ammunition.
* Lloyd George and De Valera agreed on a truce on the **11th of July 1921.**

=== Treaty ===
* Arthur Griffith & Micheal Collins went to GB to #represent.
* Eamon de valera was the president and stayed in Ireland.
* He was meant to be contacted before signing any treaty.

Ireland wanted NI and a republic.
