====== rise of nationalism ======
Created Sunday 07 October 2018

=== Background ===
* In 1801, the [[+act of union|act of union]] made Ireland part of the British empire.
* Over time Irish people realised that they were not benefiting from being part of Britain.
* In 1900, most people were **nationalists**, and wanted an Irish republic.

=== Nationalists ===
* These were the majority of the population and **catholic**.
* They felt that laws were only passed tin favour of Britain so they wanted [[+home rule|home rule]] to take back control of Ireland.
* They were led by **John Redmond**.

=== There were also unionists ===
* These were the smaller part of the population in the north and **protestant**.
* They thought that having a parliament in dublin was bad for buisness.
* They opposed home rule.
* They were led by **Edward Carson** and **James Craig**.

=== The IRB - Extreme nationalists ===
* The IRB were a more extreme group of nationalists.
* They were willing to use violence to get full independance, but they didn't do it early on because they had little influence.

Cultural nationalisom rose and Irish people began to see their culture as completely different to English culture.

=== IGWTU ===
* Trade union set up by **Jim Larkin**.
* Fought for better rights for Irish workers.
* In 1913 workers were told to leave the union or lose their jobs.
* Jim Larkins called a strike which lasted 5 months.
* In the end people left the IGWTU and went back to their jobs.
* This left unrest in the Irish working class.

A combination of **unfair workers rights**, **cultural nationalism**, and **not being represented in government** leads to the home rule crisis.
