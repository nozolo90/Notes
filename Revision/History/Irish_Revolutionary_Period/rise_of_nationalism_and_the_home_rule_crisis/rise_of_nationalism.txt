====== rise of nationalism ======
Created Sunday 07 October 2018

=== Background ===
* In 1801, the [[act of union]] made Ireland part of the British empire.
* Over time Irish people realised that they were not benefiting from being part of Britain.
* By 1900, most people were **nationalists**, and wanted an Irish republic.

== Nationalists ==
* These were the majority of the population and **catholic**.
* They felt that laws were only passed in favour of Britain so they wanted [[home rule]] to take back control of Ireland.
* They were led by **John Redmond**.

== There were also unionists ==
* These were the smaller part of the population in the north and **protestant**.
* They thought that having a parliament in dublin was bad for buisness.
* They opposed home rule.
* They were led by **Edward Carson** and **James Craig**.

== The IRB - Extreme nationalists ==
* The IRB were a more extreme group of nationalists.
* They were willing to use violence to get full independance, but they didn't do it early on because they had little influence.

=== Causes of the home rule crisis ===

== Cultural Nationalism ==
* This was when Irish people began to see their culture as completely different to English culture.
* Some people think that Ireland should have its own government because of its different culture.
 

=== Dublin lockout 1913 ===
* Many workers were treated unfairly, so **Jim Larkins** set up the Irish transport and general workers union (IGWTU).
* They **fought for** **better rights** for Irish **workers**.
* In 1913 workers were told to leave the workers union or lose their jobs.
* Jim Larkins called a strike which lasted 5 months, called the dublin lockout.
* In the end people left the workers union and went back to their jobs.
* This left big sad in the Irish working class.

A combination of
* **unfair workers rights**
* **cultural nationalism**
* **not being represented in government**
* **the economy strugling**
leads to the home rule crisis.
