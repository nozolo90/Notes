The Irish war of independance started on the 21st of January 1919 when the first Dail met. That morning 2  RIC members were assasinated.
The new first Dail had some important members, including Arthur Griffith maker of sinn fein, Eamon de valera vice president, Micheal Collins minister for finance.
Eamon went to the US to get official recognition for the Ireland. He failed this but he got 4 millionn pounds. MEanwhile Sinn Fein courts had began to replace British ones. Micheal collins raised 350k for the rebellion. About the squad. Then the black and tans come. Then the war ends. Sumthin about the treaty.
