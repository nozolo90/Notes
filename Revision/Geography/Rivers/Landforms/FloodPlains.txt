Created Saturday 19 August 2017

This lanform occurs in the [[Rivers:Stages of The River:Mature Stage|Mature and]] the [[Rivers:Stages of The River:Old Stage|Old stages]] of rivers
Flat areas of land on the sides of rivers

=== How they're formed ===
	After Heavy rain rivers overflow
	As the water spreads out across the floodplain, it looses energy and deposits its load of fertile mud called alluvium
	After many floods a thick layer of alluvium is formed
	This in very fertile soil
An example is **The Floodplains of the Nile**
