====== Lagoons ======

Created Friday 18 August 2017

=== Statement ===
* A **Lagoon** is a Bay that has been cut off from the sea by a [[Sand Spit]]

=== Development ===
* When a [[Sand Spit]] is formed it stretches across the [[The Sea:Bays and Headlands|bay]]. Eventually it reaches the other side of the bay and **closes off the water behind it**
* This creates a Saltwater **lagoon**
* The **Lagoon** might **fill up with silt and mud** due to rivers flowing into it

=== Example ===
* An example is **Lough Gill Co.Kerry**
