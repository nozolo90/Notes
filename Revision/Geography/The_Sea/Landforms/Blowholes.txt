====== Blowholes ======

Created Friday 18 August 2017


**Erosional** Landform

=== Statement ===
* A **Blowhole** is a passage from a [[Sea Caves|Cave]] to the surface

=== Development ===
* **Strong waves** come into a **sea cave** and compress the air inside it.
* This **pressure creates cracks** and loosens the rock in the roof of the cave.
* Over time the **cracks get bigger and a Blowhole develops**.
* Sea water **spurts out of the opening** during stormy weather.

* An example is The **Two Pistols Co.Donegal**
