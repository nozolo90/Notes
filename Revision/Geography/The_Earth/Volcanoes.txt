====== Volcanoes ======


Created Sunday 20 August 2017

When two [[Plates]] move apart from each other, magma(semi molten rock) can seep out of openings called **vents**
The magma comes up to the surface and cools forming mounds of [[Geography:Rocks:Types Of Rock:Igneous|Igneous]] rock
This continues ans magma seeps to out of the **vent** and cools forming a **volcanic mountain**

**Volcanoes **can erupt, releasing ash gas and hot rock into the atmosphere

=== There are three stages of a volcano ===
	**Active **- volcanoes that erupt regularly
	**Dormant** - volcanoes that have not erupted recently but could erupt again
	**Extinct **- volcanoes that have not erupted in recorded history


=== Advantages ===
	Provide Geothermal energy
	Provide fertile soil when they erupt


=== Disadvantages ===
	When they erupt they release poisonous gas
	ash can burry towns and destroy homes
	ash can cause [[Geography:Mass Movement:Types Of Mass Movement:Mudflow|mudflows]]
	hot rock can kill people
	
An example of a **Volcano** is **Mt.Etna**
