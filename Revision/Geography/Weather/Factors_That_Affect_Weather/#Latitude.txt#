* The closer a place is to the equator, the hotter it tends to be.

=== If close to equator ===
* The Sun rays dont have to travel through alot of atmosphere to get to the ground,so **less heat is lost**.
* The Sunlight is focused on a **smaller area**, so the **heat is concentrated**

=== Far from equator, the opposite is true ===
* The sun rays have to travel through **more atmosphere** to get to the ground, and **heat is lost**.
* The sun rays are focused on a **larger area** due to the curvature of the earth, so the **heat is more spread out**.
