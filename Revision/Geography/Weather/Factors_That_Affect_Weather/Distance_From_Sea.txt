====== Distance From Sea ======


Created Sunday 03 December 2017

=== Statement ===
* Places closer to the sea tend to have **warm summers** and **mild winters**.
* Places further from the sea tend to have **hot summers** and **cold winters**.

=== Development ===
__Close to sea__
* This is because in the summer the **sea slowly absorbs heat**, giving places nearer to the sea warm summers.
* In the winter, the sea slowly releases/loses heat giving places closer to the sea mild winters.
* They have a smaller temperature range.

__Far from sea__
* The **land absorbs heat quickly**, giving places further away from the sea hotter summers.
* The **land also releases/loses heat quickly** during the winter giving places futrther away from the sea colder winters.
* They have a larger temperature range.

=== Example ===
* An example is **Berlin**, **Germany** and **Shannon**, **Ireland** , both on the similar lattitudes.
* The temperature range of berlin is much larger than that of shannon because it is further inland.
