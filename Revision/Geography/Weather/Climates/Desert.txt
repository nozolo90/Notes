===== Desert Wear =====
* People in the desert wear light fitting clothes to allow air to **circulate**.
* They are white so that they can **reflect sunlight**.

===== Desertification =====
* Desertification is when land that was once **fertile** is **turned into barren desert**.
* The areas most affected are those that are at the edge of existing deserts, like the **sahel region**.
__Process__
* the soil is left **bare and exposed** -> the soil gets **blown away by the wind** -> the soil becomes **barren and infertile**.

=== Causes of desertification ===
* **Climate change**
* and human factors like **overgrazing**.

== Climate Change ==
* Rainfalls have become **unreliable**.
* The **higher emperatures** have led to more evapouration and less condensation.
* This has led to **many droughts** and **rivers and water holes** have **dried up**.

== Human Factors ==
* High birth rates have led to an **increased demand for food**.
* The people keep large herds of cattle and goats. The animals eat too much leading to **overgrazing of the land**.
* When farmers change their way of farming. When they change from grazing to crop growing, the soil loses its nutrients and the crops fail.
* Trees and shrubs are cut down speeding up erosion.

=== Results Of Desertification ===
* **Thousands have died** as a result of famine. This has had a big impact on **sudan and etheopia**.
* Many **animals have died** aswell.
* Millons of **people were forced to migrate** in search for food or aid. Many of them are Still in refugee camps. Some people have moved into urban areas, resulting in the **growth of slums**.
* Vast **areas are now infertile**.
* Livelyhoods of people are threatened, especially in countries like mali.

=== Solutions ===
* Plant **drought resistant trees** to create **shelter belts**
* Plant **dorught resistant grasses** to **bind soil**
* Use **irrigation schemes** to keep land fertile.
* **New breeds of animal** that prodice more things with less herds.
