====== Location of roads ======
Created Thursday 24 May 2018

=== Relief and drainage affect the location of roads. ===
* Roads are built on **well drained land.**
* Most roads are built on **flat lowland**. Most people live here and they are easy to build on.
* Few roads are built on **steep highland**. Few people live here and they are hard to build on.
* Roads may run through a gap  or valley to get through hills and avoid steep slopes.
