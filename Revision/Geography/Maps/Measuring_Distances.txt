=== Straight Line Distances ===
* Place the straight edge of a paper on the map so that it is passing through the two points
* Then using a pencil or a pen mark on the edge of the paper where the points are
* Put the piece of paper on the linear scale to measure thee distance between the two marks

== Curved Line Distances ==
* Place the strip of paper on the starting or first point.
* Mark both the paper edge and the map on the starting point.
* Rotate the strip of paper so that the edge goes through the center of the road
* Make a mark on the sheet of paper and the map where the road begins to curve.
* Now repeat step 3 through 5 until you reach the ending point.
