====== Fishing ======


Created Monday 21 August 2017

Fishing is a **primary** **economic** **activity** that is important to **Ireland**

Ireland is an island so it is surrounded shallow waters called **continental** **shelfs**
fish can thrive in these **continental** **shelves** which makes Irish fishing **very** **profitable**

Before Ireland joined the **EU**, other countries couldn't fish in our waters
**Small** **fishing** ports with **small** **trawlers** caught **small** **amounts** of fish
Overfishing was not an issue

== Then Ireland joined the EU ==

**Brussels** became in charge of Ireland's fishing
**Other** **European** countries could fish in our waters

The amount of fish being caught in Irish water **increased** **greatly**
Most of the catches were from **countries** **other** **than** **Ireland**
