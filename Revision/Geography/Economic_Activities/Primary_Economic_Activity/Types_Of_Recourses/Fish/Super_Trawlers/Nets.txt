====== Nets ======


Created Monday 21 August 2017

**Super Trawlers** have massive nets that can catch hundreds of tones of fish at a time

=== Types of nets ===
* **Long line** nets are long lines of rope with hooks attached to them
* **Drift nets** are horrifyingly huge nets that are submerged underwater then brought back up like a spoon in cereal
* **Trawler nets** are bag like nets that are dragged behind a super trawler to catch lots of fish
