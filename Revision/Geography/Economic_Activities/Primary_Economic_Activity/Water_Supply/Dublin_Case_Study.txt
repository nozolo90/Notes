====== Dublin Case Study ======
Created Monday 11 February 2019

**Dublin's **water supply comes from the Wicklow mountains

== Why? ==
It has a **low population density** so there's less pollution
The Bedrock is made of [[Geography:Rocks:Types Of Rock:Igneous:Granite|Granite]], a non permeable rock so **water wont drain into the soil**
high rainfall


=== Water Supply Process In Dublin ===
* Water from the **liffey **is collected in **pollaphuca lake**
* Water is piped from the lake to a **water treatment plant **near ballymore eustace.
* At the water treatment plant the water is **purified** to make it drinkable
* **Purified water **is piped to a large reservoir in **Saggart** in **Dublin**
* From that large reservoir it is piped to several **smaller reservoirs**
* from the **smaller reservoirs** water is **piped to its final consumers**
