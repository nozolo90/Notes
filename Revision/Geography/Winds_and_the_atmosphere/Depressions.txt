====== Depressions ======
Created Thursday 06 December 2018

=== Depression ===
* They are large low pressure air masses that are typically oval in shape.
* They are commonly found in mid-lattitude pareas.
* Depressions form when warm air masses move over cold air masses, setting up an area of low pressure.

=== Weather in general ===
There are **strong winds**. This can be extrapolated from the isobars that appear to be close together. Winds blow towards the low pressure center of the depression.
There is **much cloud**. Air in the low pressure center of the depression rises. As the air rises and cools, the water vapour condenses, forming clouds.
There is a good bit of **precipitation**. Condensation results in precipitaion. Frontal rain is common in depressions.

=== Weather in different places ===

== As the warm front approaches ==
* It is **cool**.
* Warm air rises over cool air resulting in **stratus clouds** and **frontal rainfall**.
* The **winds** get **stronger**.
* **Air pressure falls**.

== In a warm sector ==
* **It is warmer**.
* There are **stratus clouds from the warm front** and **light rain**.
* The **winds slow **down.
* Air **pressure is steady**?

== As the cold front passes ==
* It gets **cooler**.
* Cumulous **cloud forms** for some odd reason.
* There are **shortlived showers**.
* **Air pressure rises**.

=== Composition ===
* A **sector of warm, light air** and a **sector of colder, heavier air**.
* A warm front where the air from the warm sector slowly rises over the cold air. Frontal rainfall occurs here.
* A cold front where cold air moves under warm air and makes it rise. More frontal rainfall occurs here.
