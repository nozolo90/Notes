====== Glaciation ======
Created Tuesday 09 October 2018

===== Glacial Movement =====

=== Basal Slip < 50m ===
The bottom of the glacier is not under much pressure, so it melts.
This acts as a buffer between the frozen ground and the glacier, allowing the glacier to move along.

=== Plastic flow > 50m ===
The top of the glacier is not under as much pressure as the bottom of the glacier, so it melts.
This acts as an overhang pulling glacier forwards in an uneven motion.

===== Glacial Deposition =====

=== Moraines ===
Moraines are the names given to the material that is carried along by the glacier.
There ridges of regolith on the **sides** of a glésír are called **lateral moraines**.
* They are made up of regolith that fell down from the surround‌ing sides of the glacier.
The ridges in the **middle** of the glacier are called **medial morraines**.
* They formed when two glaciers melt and their **two lateral moraines joined together**.
When the glacier melted these moraines were deposited on the glacier valley.

=== Those sand dunes but they're rocks - drumlins? ===
Drumlins

=== Erratics ===
Rocks transported into unusual territory.

===== Glacial Erosion =====

=== Plucking and Abrasion ===
Freezw thaw and the usuall abrasion.
Plucking too.

===== Glacial Landforms =====
**cirques/corries** - A three walled basin shaped hollow formed when ice moved down the side of a mountain.
**pyramid peaks** - A pointy peak shaped landform made when 3 or more cirques formed next to each other.
**Aretes** - Steep ridges that formed when two cirques formed next to each other.
**Glaciated valleys/ U shaped valleys** - Valleys with a wide flat base and steep sides.
**Truncated spurs** - Interlocking spurs with their pointy part eroded by a moving glacier.
**Fjords** - drowned glaciated valleys
**Hanging valleys** - Tributary valleys that are high above the main glaciated valley.
