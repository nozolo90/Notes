=== Why land costs alot ===
* **There is High Demand** due to the fact that the CBD is the busiest part of the city. Many busineses want to set up here.
* **There is Low Supply**, so land is scarce and the demmand pushes up the price.

=== How the land is used ===
* **The buildings are very tall **and intensively used.
* The layers of the buildings are used for a variety of purposes.
* An example is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is used as a hotel and as a commercial office.

=== Moving Away form the city center ===
* Land values decrease as you move away from the city center.
* Land is more plentiful and less expensive.
* Therefore buldings are less dense and more spacious.
