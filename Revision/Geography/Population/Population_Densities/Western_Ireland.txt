====== Western Ireland ======
Created Saturday 12 May 2018

Western Ireland is very unpop.lulated

=== History ===
* In the 1800s, people lived off **potatoes**. The crop provided high yield for small plots.
* In the late **1850s**, the **Great** **Famine** occurred. A disease called blight destroyed the potato crop.
* The **population** **fell** **rapidly** - 1 in 4 people died or emigrated the country.
* After the famine, emigration remained high, as the area provided little employment or opurtunity so the population of the West stayed on the decrease.
* The economy improved in **1960** and **the** **population** **began** **to** **stabilize**, as emigration fell due to people having more wealth.
* In the late 90s there was an economic boom and people had even more wealth. Immigration replaced emigration and the population of the west increased.
* An economic crash in 2008, but the population increase was good enough to maintain population.

=== How does this relate to the west tho??? ===
**Rural to urban migration** has caused the decline of some country areas and population growth to other towns
__West Push Factors__
* Hilly terrain and poor soil make farming unprofitable.
* Few industries and poor employment.
* Dull social life.
__Urban Pull Factors__
* Good education.
* Better Jobs.
* More recreation.

=== Problems that this causes ===

== Abandonment of agricultural land. ==
* Agricultural land has been **neglected** and **abandoned**.
* Less people are available to work the land.
* Young adults emigrate leaving elderly people who are not able to farm the land correctly in care of the farms.
* Many small farms have now been given to **forestry**.

== Low Marriage rates. ==
* There are few jobs and less third level colleges available in the West.
* Young people emigrate because of this.
* Lots of marriageable young people are gone meaning birth rates fall and population continues to decline.

== Political and Economic Isolation. ==
* The less populated areas have less TDs to represent them.
