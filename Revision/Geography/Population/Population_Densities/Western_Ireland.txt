====== Western Ireland ======
Created Saturday 12 May 2018

Western Ireland is very unpolulated

=== History ===
* In the 19th century, people lived off potatoes. They provided high yeild for small plots.
* In the late 1850s, the Great Famine occured. A disease called blight destroyed the potato crop.
* The population fell rapppidly - 1 in 4 people died or emmigrated the country.
* After the fammine, emmigration remained high, as the area provided little employment or oppurtunity so the population of the West stayed on the decrease.
* The economy improved in 1960 and the population began to stabilize, as emmigration fell due to people having more wealth.
* In the late 90s there was an economic boom and people had even more wealth. Immigration replaced emmigration and the population of the west increased.
* An economic crash in 2008 - population increase good enough to maintain population.

=== How does this relate to the west tho??? ===
* **Rural to urban migration** has caused the decline of some country areas and population growth to other towns
__West Push Factors__

	* Few industries and poor employment.
	* Dull social life.
__West Pull Factors__
	* Good educatiom.
	* Better Jobs.
	* More recreation.

=== Problems that this causes ===
* **Abandonement of agricultural land.**
	* Agricultural land has been **neglected** and **abandoned**.
	* Less people are available to work the land.
	* Young adults emmigrate leaving elderly people who are not able to farm the land correctly in care of the farms.
	* Many small farms have now been given to **forestry**.
* **Low Marrige rates.**
	* There are few jobs and less third level colleges available in the West.
	* Young people emmigrate because of this.
	* Loths of marrigable young people are gone meaning birth r ates fall and population continues to decline.
* **Political and Economic Isolation.**
	* The less populated areas have less TDs to represent them.s1
