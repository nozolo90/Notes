Created Thursday 14 December 2017

Mali is a country with a very low population density.
It is 15 times larger than Ireland, but with only 16 million people.

=== Why people leave ===
* Young people leave Mali because they do not want to spend their life in the lightly populated, desssert like rural areas in Mali.
* Many young people (especially men) leave to cities like **Bamako** and **Timbuktu** in search for jobs, oppurtunities and education.

=== Effects of low population density ===

== Abandonment of agricultural land ==
* There are no people to farm the land.

== Fewer marriages ==
* There is surplus of men in the cities and lack in rural areas.
* Less marriages = less children, meaning that the population decreases even further.

== Political and economic isolation ==
* France conquered Mali in in 1850. Mali's population was too dispersed to defend against the french.
* They were at the edge of the empire and had no decision making power.
* They became independent in 1960.
* They were left in a very poor state.
