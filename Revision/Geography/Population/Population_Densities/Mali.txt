====== Mali ======


Created Thursday 14 December 2017

Mali is a country with a very low population density.
It is 15 times larger than Ireland, but with only 16 million people.

=== Why people leave ===
* Young people leave Mali because they do not want to spend their life in the lightly populated, desssert like rural areas in Mali.
* Many young people (especially men) leave to cities like Bamako and Timbuktu in search for jobs, oppurtunities and education.

=== Effects of low population density ===

== Abandonement of agricultural land ==
* There are no people to farm the land.

== Fewer marriges ==
* There is urplus of men in the cities and lack in rural areas.
* Less marriges = less children, meaning that the population decreases even further.

== Political and economic isolation ==
* Mali was conquered by France in 1850. Their spread out population could do nothing to defend against the empire.
* They were at the edge of the empire and had no decision making power.
* They became independant in 1960.
* They still now have no money to do anything.
