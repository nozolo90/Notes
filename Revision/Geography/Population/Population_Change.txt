====== Population Change ======
Created Saturday 18 November 2017

World Population Change is called **natural change**.
It can be calculated by measuring **birth rates** against **death rates**.

=== Birth rates - Natural Increase ===
* Number of **live births** per thousand of the population.
* When the **birth rates** are **higher** than the **death rates**, **natural increase** occurs.

=== Death rates - Natural Decrease ===
* Number of deaths per thousand of the population.
* When the **death rates** are **higher** than the **birth rates**, **natural decrease** occurs.

Countries go through **different phases** of natural increase and decrease.
Geographers have conjured up a diagram to show these changes called the **Demographic Transition Model**.
