Created Thursday 07 December 2017

=== Population Pyramids ===
* Population pyramids tell us the **age and sex sructure** of a country.
* They are made up on a series of bars, stacked on top of each other.

=== Uses ===
__Goverments can use them to tell:__
* How much they need to put into pensions, nursing homes, health care, education.
* How much they need to set the **taxes** (depending on the ammount of 24-59 year olds because they pay the most tax)

=== Comparing population pyramids of developed countries to that of developing ones ===
**Thicc base developing because**
High birth rate means that a large proportion of the population are children.
High death rate, so relatively few people make it to old age, so it has a narrow peak.
**Stick like developed because**
Family planning means that they have a low and declining birth rate so the ammount of children is low.
