====== Population Make Up ======


Created Thursday 07 December 2017

=== Population Pyramids ===
* Population pyramids tell us the **age and sex sructure** of a country.
* They are made up on a series of bars, stacked on top of each other.
* The bars on the bottom usually represent 0-4 year olds, and each bar above that is 5 years more eg the second bar would reperesent be 5-9 years old.
* The length of each bar shows the ammount of people in that group.
* They are split in half. One side reperesents women and the other reperesents men.
* We can tell the ammount of people in a certain demographic by looking at the length of a bar.
* For example,the bottom bar on the men side will tell us how many people or the percentage of the population that are 0-4 years old men.

=== Uses ===
__Goverments can use them to tell:__
* How much they need to put into pensions, nursing homes, health care, education.
* How much they need to set the taxes (depending on the ammount of 24-59 year olds because they pay the most tax)
