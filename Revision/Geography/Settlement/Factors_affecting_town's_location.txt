====== Factors affecting town's location ======
Created Saturday 12 May 2018

=== Land Quality ===
* If land is good quality, then people will live there.
* More people are in the south and the east because the land is more fertile.
* Market towns developed in areas with fertile land.
* The land in the west is not as fertile and has less development.

=== Altitude ===
* Lowland areas are good for settlement.
* They are warmer, drier, flatter an easier to build on than highland areas which are cold, wet and windy.
* Lowland areas are better serviced by transport routes.

=== Nearby Rivers ===
* Some rivers are navigable. This means that they are deep and wide enough for boats to sail on.
* Rivers provide water for drinking, transport, cooking and other domestic purposes.
* Some towns develop near bridging points of rivers. People meet at the rivers and trade develops. This causes towns to grow.
* Docks and port activities.
* Some towns develop at dry-point sites.

=== Drainage ===
* If land lacks good drainage, people won't settle there.
