====== Factors affecting town's location ======
Created Saturday 12 May 2018

=== Altitude ===
* Settlement is more likely to occur in lowland areas.
* They are warmer, drier flatter an easier to build on than highland areas which are cold, wet and windy.
* Lowland areas are better serviced by transport routes.

=== Land Quality ===
* Good land quality attracts settlement.
* This is why more people settled in the south and the east - the land is more fertile.
* Market towns developed in these areas.
* The land in the west is not as fertile.

=== Drainage ===
* Poor drainage does not attract settlement.

=== Nearby Rivers ===
* Some rivers are navigable, which means that they are deep and wide enough for boats to sail on.
* Rivers provide water for drinking, transport, cooking and other domestic purposes.
* Some towns develop near bridging points of rivers. People meet at the rivers and trade develops. This causes towns to grow.
* Docks and port activities.

* Some towns develop near dry-point sites.
