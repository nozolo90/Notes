====== The Netherland's Polders ======
Created Saturday 12 May 2018

The Netherlands is a small country with a population of **17 million people**.
It is the most **densely populated country**.
The people have reclaimed land from the sea. This gives the people farmland and more space to live.

=== Polder creation ===
//A polder is land reclaimed from the sea//
* A **large dam** was built on the mouth of a coastal inlet.
* Then, **water was pumped out** of the dam to create dry land.
* Settlements with roads and farms were then built on the polder.

The polders have acted as overspill zones for many people who lived in large cities like **Rotterdam and Amsterdam**.
Over 60% of the Netherlanders/Dutch live on polders now.

=== Cartwheel settlement pattern ===
* At the center of the town, there is a large town called **Emmelord**. It provides all the services that its residents may need.
* On the outskirts of the town, there are **smaller villages**. These provide more basic services.
* The smaller villages are connected to Emmelord by **radial roads**.
* The smaller villages are connected to each other via a **circular road**.
