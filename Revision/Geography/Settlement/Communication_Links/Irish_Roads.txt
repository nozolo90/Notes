====== Irish Roads ======
Created Saturday 12 May 2018

Irish Roads are the most commonly used form of transport.

=== Why ===
* Towns (like Naas) develop in linear patterns along roads.
* Many towns (like Navan) develop at the meeting points of roads.
* One of the reasons of Dublin's great growth is due to the hub of main roads that radiate out to other cities like Cork and Galway and Belfast.
