====== Plywood and Strip Core boards ======
Created Sunday 20 May 2018

==== Plywood ====
* Plywood is made by gluing thin **veneers (called ply)** of wood together to form a board of the required thiccness.
* Veneers are thin sheets of wood cut from a log by **rotary cutting**.
* There is **always an uneven amount of layers** in plywood, so that the top and bottom veneers face in the same direction.
* In plywood, each layer is placed 90 degrees to the layer below it so that their grains run in opposite directions. This strengthens the board.

==== Marine plywood ====
* Marine plywood **contains high quality veneers** of naturally durable timber.
* The veneers are bonded with **WBP** (Water and boil proof) glue.
* This is used where plywood will be exposed to water for long periods of time, like in shipbuilding.

==== Strip core boards ====
* Strip core boards are long lats of timber glued together and then veneered over.
* They take nails better than other boards.

===== Advantages =====
* Have good strength
* Do not warp or shrink,
* Do not split easily when nailed.
* Have smooth and uniform thickness.
* Cover large areas with uniform thickness.

===== Disadvantages =====
* Edges need to be covered with a decorative strip.
* The surface veneers are usually plain.
* You cannot nail or screw into the edges of plywood.
