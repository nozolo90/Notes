====== Opening ======
Created Wednesday 29 May 2019

=== An interesting point of view ===
//Key points//
* The point of view of the book is in the first person. Scout is telling the novel from an older age. The book is a reflection on events that have already occured. "When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow"
* This viewpoint is effective as it allows the viewpoint of a child to be expressed in a mature way.
* Scout lets us into her world through her style of narration. "it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out". We dont know who either of these characters are and we are encouraged to read on and learn more about how these characters relate to her.
* We are also brought into Scouts world when she describes her family history starting with Simon Finch

=== Interesting character relations ===
//Key points//
* We see the sibling-sibling relationship that exists between Scout and jem when Scout gives examples of them arguing about Jems arm incedent. "We were too old to settle things with a fist fight".
* We see the interesting relation ship between Scout and the adults. Atticus was her father and she described him as treating her with "courteous detatchement". Atticus is like a caring uncle. However she describes Calpurnia as having a "tyranical presense" showing that she did most of the parenting.

=== Interesting setting ===
//Key points//
* "closed doors meant illness and cold weather only", refering to the radley place.
* "A day was 24 hours but it seemed longer, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with. nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb county".

=== Mystery ===
//Key points//
* "People said he went out at night when the moon was down"
* Scout, Jem and dill's curiosity about boo makes us interested too.

In my opinion, the opening of to kill a mockingbird is a very good one. it does a good job of getting the reader's attention and makes the reader want to read on. The reasons that I'll discuss include: the interesting point of view, the character relationships, the introduction to the setting, and the mystery of boo radley.
This novel is written in the first person, and the narrator is Scout who is recalling events that have already happened. Harper Lee/ Scout uses this first person narration to allow us to enter Scout's world. This was really interesting to me when I realised it. Harper Lee was telling an amazing story with serious themes through the viewpoint of a child. One effect of this is that we see different characters how Scout sees them. Initially we had not met them, for example when Scout said "it began the summer Dill came to us. when Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out". We had not yet met either of these characters, but we are in Scouts world and we come to undestand them as she narrates the story.
The opening establishes some interesting character relations. For example, it introduced part of the sibling-sibling relationship between Scout and Jem. When they were arguing about what the root catalst for Jem breaking his arm was, Scout said "we were too old to settle things with a fist fight, so we consulted Atticus". This shows that like most siblings, their childhood included many little fights. This detail gives the characters more depth and makes them more approachable. Another character relationship established was the one between Scout and the adults. Scout has a very unique relationship with her father. She said "our father was satisfactory" and treated her and Jem with "courteous detatchement". While they are family, Scout's relationship to Atticus is more like a caring uncle. The person who does the parenting is Calpurnia who Scout describes as having a "tyranical presence" as long as she could remember.
The opening establishes an interesting setting too. The novel is set in the 1930s during the great depression. The location is a fictional town called Maycomb in Alabama.

To kill a mockingbid takes place in the tired town of maycomb during the great depression
