====== Asexual Reproduction ======
Created Monday 14 May 2018

**Asexual Reproduction -** reproduction involving 1 parent.

=== Problems ===
* Things that are produced via Asexual Reprduction are succeptible to disease.
* If a disease knows how to take down one bacteria, they can take down all of them.
* This is because organisms produced via asexual reproduction are genetically identical.

=== Passing on characteristics ===
* Child organisms will inherit all of the genes of their parents - they are genetically identical.
