====== The Breathing System ======
Created Monday 14 May 2018

=== Diaphragam - Breathing in ===
* When we breath in, our **Diaphargram** moves downwards.
* This makes the **lungs expand** and **lowers the pressure** inside of them.
* The low pressure inside of **the lungs draws in air** from outside so the pressure becomes equal again.

Air comes in through the mouth and the **Nose**.

=== The nose ===
//The nose is suitable for us inhale, because://
* The nose has **hairs and mucus** that trap dirt and air particles
* Air is **warmed and moistended** as it passes through the nose.

Air from the nose goes into the **Trachea**

=== Trachea ===
* The **Trachea** carrries air to and from the lungs.

Then the air goes into the two **Bronchus**. The Bhronchus split into many **Bronchiolioli**.

=== Bronchioli ===
* Bronchioli carry air to the air sacs called aveoli/aveolous.

=== Aveolous ===
* The aveolous are tiny air sacs that allow gas exchange between our blood and the air.
* They let oxygen (and other gases) in and Co2 and water vapour out **through diffusion**.
* The aveolous are lined with **capilleries** which absorb the air.

Our Breathing rate increases during exercise.
This is because more air has to make it to our muscles.
