====== Darwin ======
Created Monday 14 May 2018

Charles Darwin was an english biologist born in 1809.
He traveled to the **Galapagos Islands** while he was in university and made observations on the animals on the island.
In 1859, he published his theory of **Evolution by Natural Selection**.

=== Evolution by Natural Selection ===
* Evolution is the change and adaptation of species caused by the environment in which they live.

===== Darwins theory - Observations =====
* Living things produce large ammounts of offspring.
* The environment can only support a limeted ammount of organisms.
* The members of a species have inherited variations

===== Darwins Theory - Conclusions =====
* Living things struggle to survive, called the **struggle for existance** or **competition over scarce resources**.
* **Mutations(random changes)** occur in the organism's genes. Organisms with **variations** that help them live in the environment survive and pass their good genes onto their children. Organisms with unsuitable mutations are likely die out with their bad genes.

=== Types ===
* Directional - one op trait - min max.
* Stablizing - common traits - balance.

=== Examples ===
* Humans can store fat so we do not need to eat all the time.
* Ant eater has a long tounge so that it can eat ants from their base.
* The woodpecker has an extremely hard beak so that it can peck wood.
