====== Path Of Food ======


Created Friday 08 December 2017

=== Digestion is the breakdown of food ===
Our **digestive** **system** breaks down food into **smaller molecules** that can be **absorbed** by our bodies into our blood.

=== Types of digestion ===

== Physical digestion ==
* breaking down of food into smaller pieces **mechanically**/**physically**.

== Chemical digestion ==
* Using **enzymes** to break down food.
* An enzyme is a chemical made of **protien** that speeds up a chemical reaction.
* Enzymes are called **biological catalysts**.

=== Digestive System ===

== Mouth ==
* **Physical** and **Chemical digestion** occurs here.
* Teeth break food down into smaller peices.
* **Amylase** breaks down **starch** into **maltose**.

== Osophagus ==
* Chewed and moistened food is swallowed and sent down the **osophagus**.
* Food is pushed down through a muscular action called **peristalsis**.

== Stomach ==
* **Hydrochloric acid** dissolves food, softens it more and **kills bacteria**.
* The stomach produces **enzymes** that **chemically digest** food.
* The stomach also **churns up** food.

== Small intestine ==
* The small intestine produces **enzymes** that allow it to **chemically digest** food.
* Most digestion occurs **just below the stomach**.
* After that food and nutrients are absorbed into the **bloodstream**.

== Liver & Pancreas ==
* The liver produces bile to help the small intestine digest food.
* The pancreas produces many enzymes that are passed to the small intestine to help digestion including insulin.

== Large intestine ==
* The large intestine **re-absorbs water** from food.
* When the body does not absorb enough water, you get **diarea**.
* When the body absorbs too much water you get **constipation**.
* The remaining food is passed to the rectum, where faeces is stored until it is excreted out of the anus.
