Created Thursday 03 May 2018


=== Strength ===
* Strength is how good a material is at **resisting** **force**.
* Strong materials require alot of energy to permanently change their strength.
__Tensile Strength__
* How a material can resist a **pulling** **force**.
__Compressive Strength__
* How a material can resist a pushing/**compressing** **force**.

=== Stiffness ===
* This is how the material will **warp** or **bend** when force is applied.
* Some materials, like rubber are easy to bend. Others, like diamond are not.

=== Elasticity ===
* This is where a solid can be **stretched** and return to its original form.
* Solids are elastic because they are held together by stretchy bonds.

=== Hardness ===
* This is how hard it is to **cut** into a material.
* Diamond is the hardest material, so it is cut with a lazer.

=== Density ===
* This is how much matter is packed into a material.

=== Melting Point ===
* This is the point where the material will turn form a **solid** **to** **a liquid**.
