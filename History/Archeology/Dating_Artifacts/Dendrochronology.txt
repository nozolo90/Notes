Created Monday 21 August 2017

**Dendrochronology**, also known as **tree ring dating** is a type of artifact dating that is usually only useful where wood is found along with the artifact (or the artifact is made of wood).

=== Technique ===
	they look at the rings on the Timber found and compare it with Tree rings of certain times.
	They decide how old the artifact is based on which era of tree rings it matches
