====== Servitor Essay ======


Created Sunday 17 December 2017

=== Who are you? ===
* I am a servitor, a loyal english solder that foughtn against the gaelic irish in the 9 years war.

=== 9 years war ===
* The 9 years war was a battle beteeen the gaelic irish and the british.
* It started when the gaelic irish rebeled against britain in 1954 and we beat them and their spanish aid.
* 1n 1607, a few years after the war had ended, many irish earls, including hugh o'niel earl of tyrone fled to europ for more aid in ireland.
* No earl got help and they all stayed in europe - flight of the earls.

=== LAnd ===
* After the earls left, King James I consficated gaelic land and organised a plantation in ulster.
* He split the land into 6 counties, DDTFAC.
* I get 1000 acers of land. This is much easier to defent then the estates given to people in the munster palntation  which could be up to 8000 acers.

=== How u ===
* Right now in 1640, there are around 40,000 of us. We are mostly presbbytarian.

=== County Derry ===
* King James planned especially well for County Derry.
* He handed it over to trade guilds like the vinters, the goldsmiths and the drapers.
* This was great idea as the had experience setting rules, standards and building shops.
* They have now built a great wall around londonderry. the walls are thick and made of stone - great defence.
* There is also bulvarks, big enough for cannons.

=== My estate ===
* In my estate, i have built a bawn(wall) around my house for good defence.

=== What we brought over ===
* We brought over arable farming - farming that focuses more on crops liike wheat and barley rather than animals.

=== Future ===
* I see a violent future for ulster. The irish are not happy that we took their land.
