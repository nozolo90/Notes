====== Knight ======


Created Wednesday 23 August 2017

There would be a dubbing ceremony where the squire would become a knight

He would spend the previous knight praying to **God**.

At the ceremony the lord would tap his two shoulders with a sword and say " **arise** **sir** **knight**"

=== Clothes worn ===
	**Red** - willing to bleed
	**White** - to show you only have one lord
	**Black** - willing to die for your lord
