**Huge** **fires** were first put beside the rock face to heat up the stone. 
Then, **water** was thrown on the **hot** **rock**. This **rapid** **cooling** caused the rocks to **crack**, exposing the rocks containing **copper**.
these **copper**-**containing** rocks were then collected.
Stone hammers were used to break the rock into smaller pieces so that there was less rock and more **copper**.
these rocks were then put into a big fire to melt them into a liquid.
the liquid is then poured into stone molds to make **copper** tools ( called **casting** ).
To make a **stone mold**, you carve the shape you want your bronze tool to be into a rock.
